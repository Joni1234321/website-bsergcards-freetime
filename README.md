# My website
Working version, Archived website  
DEMO: https://bsergcards.azurewebsites.net/Projects 

I was going to add a user system, so each user could only see their own Projects when i archived the project!  

Therefore the projects are visible to all that enter the website, and everyone can edit everything.  

## How to Add a project
No way to access the page unless you use the URL: https://bsergcards.azurewebsites.net/CreateProject

## How to edit project
No way to access the page unless you use the URL: https://bsergcards.azurewebsites.net/ChangeProject/n  
where n is the project id.  

For example  
i have created a project with the URL https://bsergcards.azurewebsites.net/Project/6, and i want to change it!
i would then change "Project" to "ChangeProject", which then becomes https://bsergcards.azurewebsites.net/ChangeProject/6


## What is this
A website i created in my free time, it is used to store information about personal ongoing projects
